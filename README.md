# numbers.sh

This code is a bash script that will prompt the user to type a positive integer and will print all the numbers from 1 up to \
and include the number entered by the user and whether or not the number is odd or even. 

For example, if the user enters in 5, the program will return:
  * 1 Odd 
  * 2 Even
  * 3 Odd
  * 4 Even
  * 5 Odd
